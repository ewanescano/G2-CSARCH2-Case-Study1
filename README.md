## 1. Introduction


The budget-friendly PC that our group built is designed as a mid-range system that can be used for gaming and general productivity. It has an Intel i5-12400F CPU with an RX 6600 GPU. Which can produce a strong performance for games and everyday applications, while our 32 GB of RAM ensures a smooth multitasking. The components that our PC haves focuses on performance without unnecessary extras.  Our group decided to have a budget around 40,000 PHP which shows that our build balances cost and performance carefully. We cut our cost by choosing a budget motherboard, a 550W PSU, and a simple case with built-in fans which allowed our build to have core performance components (GPU,CPU,RAM).

## 4. Compatibility Justification
For each part, explain compatibility and choices.  
Example:  
- **CPU + GPU Choice Consideration**: We initially wanted a newer model of CPU's such as the intel 13th Gen or 14th Gen but those costed too much for the recommended playing resolution while also having stability issues (reference:https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/processors/a-year-later-and-over-six-months-since-the-last-patch-intel-is-still-releasing-updates-to-fix-instability-problems-with-its-13th-and-14th-gen-raptor-lake-cpus/)
- **CPU + GPU Choice Consideration pt 2**: We chose the rx 6600 instead of other competitors such as NVIDIA or Intel because their RX6600 card is the one the fit all our criterion for building the budget gaming pc having 8GB VRAM and a strong enough chip to handle games
- **CPU + Motherboard**: i5-12400F uses LGA1700 socket, fully supported by MSI PRO B760M-P.

- **RAM + Motherboard**: 32 GB DDR4-3600 matches the B760M-P’s DDR4 slots and supported capacity/speed.

- **Storage**: TEAMGROUP MP33 1 TB NVMe fits the motherboard’s M.2 PCIe 3.0 ×4 slot.

- **Graphics Card**: RX 6600 fits the PCIe ×16 slot and case with no clearance issues.

- **Power Supply**: 550 W PSU provides enough power and connectors for CPU and GPU.

- **Case & Cooling**: Tecware mATX case fits all parts, and AK400 cooler supports LGA1700.

## 5. Budget Analysis
- **Budget Limit**: ₱40,000 / $685.60 (as of Oct. 1, 2025)  
- **Final Total**: ₱39,515 (local build) / $646.94 (PCPartPicker) - Without CPU cooler and case price due to unavailability. 
- ✅ Within budget for localbuild   
-  ❌ A little over budget for PCPartPicker build  
- Notes on trade-offs 
    * Mid-range CPU and strong GPU balance performance and cost.

    * 32 GB RAM boosts multitasking but raises total price.

    * Budget motherboard cuts extra features to save money.

    * 550 W PSU is cheaper but limits future upgrades.

    * Single SSD reduces storage cost.

    * Basic case and cooler lower overall build price.

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings
Reflections on:  
- Price differences (international vs. Manila vendors)
  - We appreciated how local pricing and availability can significantly influence builds like ours, which forces us to compromise and settle with the available parts locally compared to international pricing.
- Challenges in finding stock or cheaper equivalents
- What the group learned about PC components and system design
  - **Practical knowledge on surface level computer architecture**: How factors such as CPU, Chipsets, RAM types affect compatibility between computer parts
  - **Balance budget vs. Performance**: focusing on certain drivers of the build whilst cutting cost on secondary parts to prioritize the main function of this PC build (entry-level gaming build)
  - **Trade-offs are inevitable**: In our case, some trade-offs were necessary to stay within the budget, such as skipping secondary storage, and using included fans to help free the budget for the CPU and GPU.
